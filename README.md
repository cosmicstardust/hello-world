mini introduction tutorial

This is a tutorial I am following step by step from the website Git-Hub, but I would like to call it Git Gud haha!
I am hopeful I won't be distracted by the many Internet distractions that are out there and the games in my computer so I can finish this course and accomplish something worth sharing with other people, so I can be somewhat important.
